## Development Environment

**System**:	Mac OS X 10.9.5    
**Python**: 2.7.5

## Approach  

Problem was to get the number of problems solved on [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net) given his username.
The data returned by project euler was in the form of an image only. So the image was to converted to text and the data
was to be extracted from that.

Below is how I approached the problem

**1)** Check the EXIF data returned by the image to get any relevant info.

On doing a quick google search to solve the problem, i came across an article which was about extracting EXIF data from an image. I wrote the code to extract the data, but **nothing useful** came out of it.
