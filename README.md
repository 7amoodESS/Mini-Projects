A collection of various mini projects

##Python
**1) Search Engine**

A search engine which i am building as a part of Udacity CS101 class. The web crawler has been completed and all the code till unit 4 is present in the file.

**2) Compare Reddit Karma**

An application to compare the reddit karma of users based on their latest 25 posts. The number of users have been limited to two to avoid too many requests to the reddit server. This script prints out the number of likes and the number of comments on the posts of the reddit users which the user inputs. It also handles cases of invalid users.

**3) What's The Weather**


**4) Phrase Frequency Counter**

An application to count how many times a particular phrase has been repeated in a given input. The user has to choose how many words a phrase would contain and then the code would display all the possible phrases
of that many words and their counts. 
Validation issues of common inputs have been taken care of.

An application with basic image recognition capabilities. Currently a threshold function has been added, but the progress is halted because of errors which are listed in the errors.txt file.
